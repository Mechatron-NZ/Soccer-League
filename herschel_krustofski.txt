Dear Hyman and Rachel Krustofski

This season Herschel Krustofski has been selected to play for the Dragons. WOOSH go Dragons!
                        
You may be wondering why you are not in the same team as last year.
Unfortunately we have decide that disbanding the previous teams and creating new more balanced teams
was in the best interests of the League. We understand that football is a competitive sport however,
in children's games fun and good sportsmanship should be the priority.
This also applies to parents! I feel I shouldn't have to say this but given
the incident last season with the grapes, wheel chair and harsh words now all over facebook
I feel I must remind you such behaviour is unacceptable.
Your fist practice session is on March 17th @ 1pm at Saxton Field, field 2.

Kind Regards
Joshua Wilson
(Teams Coordinator)
